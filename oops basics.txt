VARIABLES:
we have variables of two types:
	instance variable: as object changes,values changes.(defining inside variable)
	class or static variable:it shares all the objects.(defining outside variable)
METHODS:
	instance method:two types/ accessor:fetching the value of instance variable eg:def get_x(self) hence called as getter methods.
                                 \ mutator: modifying the value of instance variable eg:def set_x(self,value) hence called as setter methods.
	class method
	static method
